# hello-world
My first repository
Hi I'm Frank, a web designer and front end developer from Belgium. When I'm not hitting the Mac keyboard, I'm hitting the drums or eating spicy food. For the next few months I want to sharpen my developer skills by learning javascript back from the beginning. Until now I've always stolen bits of javascript code from the web and tweaked them to my needs if I could, but now I feel it is time to become a real front end master with my own magic tricks up my sleeve. Time to get seriously good at it.
